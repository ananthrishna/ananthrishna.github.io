My name is Anantha Krishnan, I got my bachelor’s and master’s dual degree from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Thiruvananthapuram with strong expertise in Quantum Information Theory and Machine Learning. I am currently working as a Research Student with Prof.Anil Shaji, complementing both analytical techniques & machine learning towards understanding Quantum Network Nonlocality. 

I aspire to understand nonclassical correlations of quantum systems, ultimately seeking a measure using theoretical physics & machine learning. I am interested in the Quantum causal structure approaches to study these correlations, and I have been studying the special case of Quantum Causal Networks, making use of LHV-Neural networks as a witness for non-classical correlations. Also for this goal, I am also looking into quantum enhanced simulation techniques and machine learning to bridge the classical computational intractabilty when learning these quantum systems. 

In my academic journey, I majored in Physics (Quantum Information Theory) with strong expertise in Quantum theory and have excelled in courses such as Quantum Information Theory, Quantum Foundations, Quantum Many-Body Physics. My research project on Nonlocality in Quantum Networks using Machine Learning under Prof. Anil Shaji and Dr. Debashis Saha, which was also my Major thesis in 2023 was awarded the Chanakya Fellowship by I-HUB QTF National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber Physical Systems, of the Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India for contribution to Quantum Technologies. As part of this project, I expanded over the established quantum distributions capable of violating network locality, and have found the best measurement choices for these quantum states and their noise robustness. I also took comprehensive courses & schools in programming, mathematics, and multiple interdisciplinary topics including computational neuroscience. These experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in Quantum Information Theory and its interdisciplinary depth, and a keen interest in advancing my expertise through a PhD. 

Currently, I am continuing my research to reframe the locality constraint of Quantum networks by integrating coarse-graining tactics, tweaking output cardinalities, and the noise robustness of the states. I am working with generic networks to eventually introduce a programming package for Quantum Network Nonlocality. The metaheuristic algorithms inspired by evolutionary schemes I learned during my Minor in Data Science under Dr. Nagaiah Chamakuri helped in experimenting with different hybrid optimizers. My Data Science minor was on the Superadditivity of Coherent Information in Noisy Quantum Channels by making use of the RBM Neural Network architecture and Genetic Algorithms for global optimization. My research endeavors have significantly honed my abilities in both analytical and machine learning methods, and in using both holistically. I am also presenting my current work at the Frontier Symposium Physics 2024 at IISER Thiruvananthapuram. I am in the process of publishing my results which can be checked in my portfolio. 

The rich exposure to academic and cultural events at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Thiruvananthapuram (IISER TVM) allowed me to develop important networking and leadership skills. I coordinated the 23rd NCAMP conference school on Atomic and Molecular Physics and Quantum Technology in IISER TVM organized by Prof. Anil Shaji in IISER TVM. I have also organized and volunteered for debates and discussions as part of the Humanities collective of IISER TVM. I have attended several workshop and schools, which are outlined in my CV; including the the Qiskit series Qiskit Global Summer School 2020 (Introduction to Quantum Computing and Quantum Algorithms), Qiskit Global Summer School 2021 (Introduction to Quantum Machine Learning), Qiskit Global Summer School 2022 (Introduction to Quantum Simulations), and Qiskit Global Summer School 2023 (Theory to Implementation). I als recieved the Qiskit Qauntum Excellence Award. 

Right now I am also carrying out a project in collaboration with Cloud Cuckoo Land(CCL), India on developing an Intent Recognition Chatbot Platform for Mental Health Applications, that is aimed at making use of a statistical system of emotion parameters making to predict the emotional compulsiveness and volatility. This work is a collaboration with a medical agency - CCL to create an open platform, towards making mental health awareness and help available to all. 

Quantum network systems are interesting as they lead to genuine nonlocality without inputs that are unlike any Bell nonlocality, and exploring higher dimensional multipartite domains helps us understand new quantum nature like intrinsic randomness. I am looking forward to this domain and to using Quantum causal models and techniques (Quantum Inflation) to understand and define better witnesses to characterize as well as measure nonclassical correlations. My experience involves designing LHV-Neural networks whose DAGs match the topology of the Quantum Causal Network, which inner approximates the local model that best expresses the network correlations. These local models are strongly related to the causal network. I am interested and experienced in complementing machine learning in research and I find it is of great applicability in the causality community. Coming to my goals in computation, from my experience of hitting a classically intractable wall in quantum causal networks and the superadditvity of noisy quantum channels, both of which are projects I worked on. I am looking forward to designing and developing Quantum algorithms and Quantum-enhanced simulation techniques to simulate and understand such systems. And I have grown to find that reading extensively in these domains is not just productive but also exciting and fulfilling. I aspire to combine my interest and expertise in these fields towards my learning goals. 

For my doctoral studies, I wish to pursue research in Quantum Information Theory, particularly in understanding systems of a quantum nature through Quantum enhanced simulation and Machine Learning. I am looking forward to improving my understanding of Quantum Causal Structures and Non-classical correlations, with importance to its foundational nature & emergent application. My projects helped me enjoy research as well as get into reading on research on Causal Structures in Quantum Foundation, Entanglement resources and Quantum-enhanced algorithms in Quantum Information Theory, and applications from interdisciplinary research including evolutionary algorithms from machine learning.
