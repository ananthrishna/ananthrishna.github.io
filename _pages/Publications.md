### Quantum Network Nonlocality with X States

A manuscript based on the work done is being prepared, for updates, please check here.

Abstract

Nonlocal correlations lie at the core of quantum foundations, and distributions displaying them are of great importance in applications of information processing. Unlike quantum systems with a convex local boundary, the nonlocality without inputs in networks is of particular interest as it deviates from the standard bell inequality violation criteria. Nonlocality being a correlation that canâ€™t be reproduced by a classical structure, machine learning with classical sources was later introduced as a counter test for the same. These works were particular to bell states; we are expanding on this work with X states and joint entangled measurements. Consequently, we have observed the measurement choices for X states with two-parameter entangled Bell state measurements, which can be almost confidently extrapolated to all two qubit quantum sources capable of showing recognizable nonlocal correlations. Then we further categorized the states showing higher nonlocal correlations and their respective measurement range. We backed up our results with noise robustness of these nonlocal distributions and their further analyses. We also came across and further explored whether a triangle network can produce nonlocal correlation with just entangled measurements on classically correlated states and analytically proved that we cannot. Exploring this new domain of nonlocality will give us glimpses into the defining principles of quantum nonlocality and its wide applications.

### Minor Thesis - Superadditivity of Coherent Information in Noisy Quantum Channels

Abstract

 Machine learning has greatly improved the attainability of solutions when it comes to challenging problems such as those in fundamental research. Here, we use machine learning to tackle a quantum information scenario. Quantum channels exhibit a convenient property called superadditivity which can improve transmission rates in quantum information channels. In this work we found quantum states expressing Superadditivity using neural network variational ansatz and optimization algorithms; through this we explored the usefulness of using neural network as a variational state ansatz for representing Quantum qubit states in the context of quantum information-processing tasks, and also the efficiency of using different optimization algorithms to find the better case. (a) Neural network states yield quantum codes with a high Coherent-information for Qubit pauli channels, Dephrasure channel and De polarizing channel; such codes have proven to outperform all other known codes for these channels. (b) It has also been shown that the quantum codes for single channel cases were given by repetition codes. (c) Using genetic algorithm has proved to be more effective than using simple gradient-based methods for optimizing the neural network ansatz representing the states.
