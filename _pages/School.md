#### Coursework

I got my bachelor's and master's dual degree in Physics from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Thiruvananthapuram (5 yrs) with strong expertise in Quantum Information Theory and Machine Learning in 2023 as a Physics major and Data science minor.
In my academic journey, I majored in Physics (Quantum Information Theory) with strong foundations in Electromagnetism, Classical, Statistical, and Quantum mechanics, Condensed Matter Physics, Atomic, and Nuclear physics courses, and excellence in advanced courses in Quantum Foundations, Quantum Information Theory, Quantum Many-Body Theory, Electrodynamics with Special and General theories of relativity, Quantum Field Theories.

For my Master's thesis in Quantum Information theory under the guidance of Prof. Anil Shaji and Dr. Debashis Saha, I worked on "Exploring Triangle Nonlocality using Machine Learning" on which a manuscript is currently being prepared and will be open to peer-review.

I have taken comprehensive courses in Programming, Differential equations and analysis, and multiple interdisciplinary courses. I have excelled in courses on Machine Learning and Computational techniques, Probability and Statistics, Advanced Mathematical methods, and Data and Statistical models.

For my Minor thesis in Data Science under the guidance of Dr. Nagaiah Chamakuri, I worked on "Superadditivity of Coherent Information in Noisy Quantum Channels"

I have a total CGPA of 8.34 out of 10 with excellent overalls in Quantum Information Theory and Machine Learning methodologies with exceptional grades for both my Major and Minor Thesis Projects.
