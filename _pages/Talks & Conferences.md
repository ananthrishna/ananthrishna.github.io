Selected Experiences
======

### Research Fellow: Quantum Network Nonlocality without inputs using Neural Network Oracle (Ongoing) IISER TVM, India 
- Working with Prof. Anil Shaji and Dr. Debashis Saha on Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Foundations from a Machine learning standpoint & was awarded the Chanakya Fellowship (I-HUB QTF) under the National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber Physical Systems, of the Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India 
- Master Thesis Defense (2023) - I have found the best measurement setting for maximal nonlocality for X states & a convenient model in complex multipartite domains. I am in the process of publishing my results. 

### Research Project: "Superadditivity of Coherent Information in Noisy Quantum Channels"(2022) IISER TVM, India 
- Minor Thesis Defense - Worked with Dr. Nagaiagh Chamakuri on the application of Meta-heuristic algorithms for finding quantum states (RBM Architecture) that showed Superadditivity of coherent information. 
- Meta-heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithms were significanty better conventional gradient descent because it bypassed the issue of optimization getting stuck in local optimas 

### Project: "Semi Definite Programming(SDP) and POPs"
- Experienced with using SDP, SOS approaches for Polynomial Optimization Problems(POPs) and its Non-commutative counterpart with SOHS, solving them as a semi-definite program. 
- NCSOStools and NCAlgebra for SOHS check, trace min, eigen min, etc.
- SDP for Geometry, Dynamical system theory, and NP-Hard problems (using the cvxp package).

### Project: Bell's Theorem, Random Number Certification, and Quantum Causdal Models (2020) IISER TVM, India
- Presented Bell's Theorem and the Bohr-Einstein debate, and its importance in random number generation under Prof. Manik Banik
- Later, delved into Causal box formalism and Process matrix formalism for understanding Quantum Causal Networks.

### Project: Quantum Circuits, Algorithms, and Computation.
- Experienced with designing Quantum Circuits, Quantum Machine Learning(qNNs, qGANs, qSVM using Qiskit), Clifford Cicuits and Gates.
- Tensor Network circuits such as MPS and Tree Tensor Quantum Circuit for Ideal and Noisy Simulations
- Quantum Error Correction and Gate Decompositions
- Experiencedwith Pennylane, Qiskit, Tensorflow Quantum, etc.

### Research Assistant: Variational principles for finding quantum bound states (2019) IISER TVM, India 
- Did a project on Variational principles for finding quantum bound states using Mathematica and Matlab under Prof. Anil Shaji. 
- Made use of various shooting and relaxation algorithms, including the Gauss-Seidel iterative algorithm on electron wave function and energy.

### Group Project: Exploring dynamics of Chua’s circuit (2022) IISER TVM, India 
- This was a group project where we set up Chua’s circuit to study the evolution of its classic chaotic behavior. 
- I learned how important project management skills are when it comes to research.

### Colab: Chatbot Platform for Mental Health applications Cloud Cuckoo Land, India. 
- Working on a intent-recognizing chatbot for mental health applications, by making use of a statistical system of emotion parameters making it possible for the platform to predict the user’s emotional compulsiveness.

In my academic journey, I majored in Physics (Quantum Information Theory) with strong foundations in electromagnetism, mechanics, atomic and nucleur physics courses \& excellence in Quantum Many-Body Theory, Quantum Foundations, and Quantum Information Theory. I have conducted research on Quantum Causal Networks and Quantum information processing capacities of channels using Machine Learning. I also took comprehensive courses in programming, differential equations, and analysis and multiple interdisciplinary courses.  These experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in Quantum Information Theory and Machine Learning and a keen interest in advancing my expertise through a Ph.D. I am particulalry interested in complement in Theoretical physics, Mathematical analysis and Machine learning in my research endeavours.
