### About Me

My name is Anantha Krishnan, I got my bachelor’s and master’s dual degree from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Thiruvananthapuram with strong expertise in Quantum Information Theory and Machine Learning. I am currently working as a Research Student with Prof.Anil Shaji, complementing both analytical techniques & machine learning towards understanding Quantum Network Nonlocality. 

I aspire to understand nonclassical correlations of quantum systems, ultimately seeking a measure using theoretical physics & machine learning. 

I am interested in the Quantum causal structure approaches to study these correlations, and I have been studying the special case of Quantum Causal Networks, making use of LHV-Neural networks as a witness for non-classical correlations. 

Also for this goal, I am also looking into quantum enhanced simulation techniques and machine learning to bridge the classical computational intractabilty when learning these quantum systems. 


Selected Experiences
======

### Quantum Network Nonlocality without inputs using Neural Network Oracle (Ongoing) IISER TVM, Kerala, India 
• Working with **Prof. Anil Shaji** and **Dr. Debashis Saha** on Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Foundations from a Machine learning standpoint & was awarded the Chanakya Fellowship (I-HUB QTF) under the National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber Physical Systems, of the Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India 
• Master Thesis Defense (2023) - I have found the best measurement setting for maximal nonlocality for X states & a convenient model in complex multipartite domains. I am in the process of publishing my results. 

### "Superadditivity of Coherent Information in Noisy Quantum Channels"(2022) IISER TVM, Kerala, India 
• Minor Thesis Defense - Worked with Dr. Nagaiagh Chamakuri on the application of Meta-heuristic algorithms for finding quantum states (RBM Architecture) that showed Superadditivity of coherent information. 
• Meta-heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithms were significanty better conventional gradient descent because it bypassed the issue of optimization getting stuck in local optimas 

### Variational principles for finding quantum bound states (2019) IISER TVM, Kerala, India 
• Did a project on Variational principles for finding quantum bound states using Mathematica and Matlab under Prof. Anil Shaji. 
• Made use of various shooting and relaxation algorithms, including the Gauss-Seidel iterative algorithm on electron wave function and energy 

### Exploring dynamics of Chua’s circuit (2022) IISER TVM, Kerala, India 
• This was a group project where we set up Chua’s circuit to study the evolution of its classic chaotic behavior. 
• I learned how important project management skills are when it comes to research. Signal locality, 

### Unpredictability and Random number certification (2020) IISER TVM, Kerala, India 
• Did a presentation on Bell’s theorem and the whole Bohr, Einstein debate, and its importance in random number generation. 

### Quantum Simulation using Qiskit (2022) IISER TVM, Kerala, India 
• Experienced in using Qiskit software Quantum Simulation problems using Quantum Algorithms - Qiskit Global Summer School Intent recognition 

### Chatbot Platform for Mental Health applications (Ongoing) Cloud Cuckoo Land, India. 
• Working on a intent-recognizing chatbot for mental health applications, by making use of a statistical system of emotion parameters making it possible for the platform to predict the user’s emotional compulsiveness.

In my academic journey, I majored in Physics (Quantum Information Theory) with strong foundations in electromagnetism, mechanics, atomic and nucleur physics courses \& excellence in Quantum Many-Body Theory, Quantum Foundations, and Quantum Information Theory. I have conducted research on Quantum Causal Networks and Quantum information processing capacities of channels using Machine Learning. I also took comprehensive courses in programming, differential equations, and analysis and multiple interdisciplinary courses.  These experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in Quantum Information Theory and Machine Learning and a keen interest in advancing my expertise through a Ph.D. I am particulalry interested in complement in Theoretical physics, Mathematical analysis and Machine learning in my research endeavours.
