### About Me
=======
This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

My name is Anantha Krishnan, I got my bachelor’s and master’s dual degree from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Thiruvananthapuram with strong expertise in Quantum Information Theory and Machine Learning. I am currently working as a Research Student with Prof.Anil Shaji, complementing both analytical techniques & machine learning towards understanding Quantum Network Nonlocality. 

I aspire to understand quantum systems and their correlations that makes them so special, I am experienced and I enjoy complementing theoretical physics & machine learning in my research.

I am interested in the Quantum causal structure approaches to study these correlations, and I have been studying the special case of Quantum Causal Networks, making use of LHV-Neural networks as a witness for non-classical correlations. 

Also for this goal, I am also looking into quantum enhanced simulation techniques and machine learning to bridge the classical computational intractabilty when learning these quantum systems.

Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

### Quantum Network Nonlocality without inputs using Neural Network Oracle (Ongoing) IISER TVM, Kerala, India 
• Working with **Prof. Anil Shaji** and **Dr. Debashis Saha** on Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Foundations from a Machine learning standpoint & was awarded the Chanakya Fellowship (I-HUB QTF) under the National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber Physical Systems, of the Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India 
• Master Thesis Defense (2023) - I have found the best measurement setting for maximal nonlocality for X states & a convenient model in complex multipartite domains. I am in the process of publishing my results. 

### "Superadditivity of Coherent Information in Noisy Quantum Channels"(2022) IISER TVM, Kerala, India 
• Minor Thesis Defense - Worked with Dr. Nagaiagh Chamakuri on the application of Meta-heuristic algorithms for finding quantum states (RBM Architecture) that showed Superadditivity of coherent information. 
• Meta-heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithms were significanty better conventional gradient descent because it bypassed the issue of optimization getting stuck in local optimas 

### Variational principles for finding quantum bound states (2019) IISER TVM, Kerala, India 
• Did a project on Variational principles for finding quantum bound states using Mathematica and Matlab under Prof. Anil Shaji. 
• Made use of various shooting and relaxation algorithms, including the Gauss-Seidel iterative algorithm on electron wave function and energy 

### Exploring dynamics of Chua’s circuit (2022) IISER TVM, Kerala, India 
• This was a group project where we set up Chua’s circuit to study the evolution of its classic chaotic behavior. 
• I learned how important project management skills are when it comes to research. Signal locality, 

### Unpredictability and Random number certification (2020) IISER TVM, Kerala, India 
• Did a presentation on Bell’s theorem and the whole Bohr, Einstein debate, and its importance in random number generation. 

### Quantum Simulation using Qiskit (2022) IISER TVM, Kerala, India 
• Experienced in using Qiskit software Quantum Simulation problems using Quantum Algorithms - Qiskit Global Summer School Intent recognition 

### Chatbot Platform for Mental Health applications (Ongoing) Cloud Cuckoo Land, India. 
• Working on a intent-recognizing chatbot for mental health applications, by making use of a statistical system of emotion parameters making it possible for the platform to predict the user’s emotional compulsiveness.

In my academic journey, I majored in Physics (Quantum Information Theory) with strong foundations in electromagnetism, mechanics, atomic and nucleur physics courses \& excellence in Quantum Many-Body Theory, Quantum Foundations, and Quantum Information Theory. I have conducted research on Quantum Causal Networks and Quantum information processing capacities of channels using Machine Learning. I also took comprehensive courses in programming, differential equations, and analysis and multiple interdisciplinary courses.  These experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in Quantum Information Theory and Machine Learning and a keen interest in advancing my expertise through a Ph.D. I am particulalry interested in complement in Theoretical physics, Mathematical analysis and Machine learning in my research endeavours.

=======
I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
