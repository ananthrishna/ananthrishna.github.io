My name is Anantha Krishnan, I got my bachelor's and master's dual degree from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Thiruvananthapuram with strong expertise in Quantum Information Theory and Machine Learning in July 2023. I am currently working as a Research Student with Dr.Anil Shaji, complementing both analytical \& computational techniques on researching Quantum Network Nonlocality.

I aspire to improve the understanding on quantum correlations of importance to Quantum information science, from the answers on its foundational nature, to answering emerging quantum technology, using theoretical and computational techniques in a holistic nature.

Selected Experiences
======
In my academic journey, I majored in Physics (Quantum Information Theory) with strong foundations in electromagnetism, mechanics, atomic and nucleur physics courses \& excellence in Quantum Many-Body Theory, Quantum Foundations, and Quantum Information Theory. I have conducted research on [Exploring Nonlocality in Quantum Networks using Machine Learning under Prof. Anil Shaji and Dr. Debashis Saha]. This work was partly inspired by \href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.140401}{Renou. et al} and was part of my [Major thesis]. I also took comprehensive courses in programming, differential equations, and analysis and multiple interdisciplinary courses.  These experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in Quantum Information Theory and Machine Learning and a keen interest in advancing my expertise through a Ph.D.

I have had an exciting and diverse set of research experiences which I have outlined in my CV, of these, two of the most impactful projects for me were one in my fourth year, where I delved deeper into machine learning assisted physics research. I was fascinated by the workings of Neural networks and Random tree algorithms, which led me to take Data Science for my [Minor]; I soon went on to do my project with Dr. Nagaiah Chamakuri where we tried to find the [Quantum states that showed Superadditivity of Coherent Information when passed through a Noisy Quantum Channel]. This exposed me to a wide variety of scientific computing tools, meta-heuristic algorithms being one of them. The work I did here on metaheuristic algorithms, TensorFlow, and MPI parallelism helped me with my next project on using [Machine Learning for exploring non-locality in Quantum Networks without inputs] which was also my [Master's thesis]. Network structures that obey locality constraints can be matched using Neural networks because their Direct Acyclic Graphs match, using this it has been shown that a sufficiently trained neural network reproducing a nonlocal distribution can be a good witness for its nonlocality. We expanded on the existing research to combinations of Bell states forming X states with two parameter entangled joint measurements and we have found the best measurement choices for these X states and their pattern.

Awards
======
I was also awarded the Chanakya Fellowship by I-HUB QTF National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber Physical Systems, of the Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India for my project on Quantum Technologies.
