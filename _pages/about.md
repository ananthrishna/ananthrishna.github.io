About Me
======
My name is Anantha Krishnan, I got my bachelor’s and master’s dual degree from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Thiruvananthapuram with strong expertise in Quantum Information Theory and Machine Learning. I am currently working as a Research Student with Prof.Anil Shaji, complementing both analytical techniques & machine learning towards understanding Quantum Network Nonlocality. 

I aspire to understand nonclassical correlations of quantum systems, ultimately seeking a measure using theoretical physics & machine learning. 

I am interested in the Quantum causal structure approaches to study these correlations, and I have been studying the special case of Quantum Causal Networks, making use of LHV-Neural networks as a witness for non-classical correlations. 

Also for this goal, I am also looking into quantum enhanced simulation techniques and machine learning to bridge the classical computational intractabilty when learning these quantum systems. 


Selected Experiences
======
In my academic journey, I majored in Physics (Quantum Information Theory) with strong foundations in electromagnetism, mechanics, atomic and nucleur physics courses \& excellence in Quantum Many-Body Theory, Quantum Foundations, and Quantum Information Theory. I have conducted research on [Exploring Nonlocality in Quantum Networks using Machine Learning under Prof. Anil Shaji and Dr. Debashis Saha]. This work was partly inspired by \href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.140401}{Renou. et al} and was part of my [Major thesis]. I also took comprehensive courses in programming, differential equations, and analysis and multiple interdisciplinary courses.  These experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in Quantum Information Theory and Machine Learning and a keen interest in advancing my expertise through a Ph.D.

I have had an exciting and diverse set of research experiences which I have outlined in my CV, of these, two of the most impactful projects for me were one in my fourth year, where I delved deeper into machine learning assisted physics research. I was fascinated by the workings of Neural networks and Random tree algorithms, which led me to take Data Science for my [Minor]; I soon went on to do my project with Dr. Nagaiah Chamakuri where we tried to find the [Quantum states that showed Superadditivity of Coherent Information when passed through a Noisy Quantum Channel]. This exposed me to a wide variety of scientific computing tools, meta-heuristic algorithms being one of them. The work I did here on metaheuristic algorithms, TensorFlow, and MPI parallelism helped me with my next project on using [Machine Learning for exploring non-locality in Quantum Networks without inputs] which was also my [Master's thesis]. Network structures that obey locality constraints can be matched using Neural networks because their Direct Acyclic Graphs match, using this it has been shown that a sufficiently trained neural network reproducing a nonlocal distribution can be a good witness for its nonlocality. We expanded on the existing research to combinations of Bell states forming X states with two parameter entangled joint measurements and we have found the best measurement choices for these X states and their pattern.

Awards
======
I was also awarded the Chanakya Fellowship by I-HUB QTF National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber Physical Systems, of the Department of Science and Technology, Govt. of India for my project on Quantum Technologies.
