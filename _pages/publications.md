### Quantum Network Nonlocality with X States

A manuscript based on the work done is being prepared, for updates, please check here.

Abstract

Nonlocal correlations lie at the core of quantum foundations, and distributions displaying them are of great importance in applications of information processing. Unlike quantum systems with a convex local boundary, the nonlocality without inputs in networks is of particular interest as it deviates from the standard bell inequality violation criteria. Nonlocality being a correlation that can't be reproduced by a classical structure, machine learning with classical sources was later introduced as a counter test for the same. These works were particular to bell states, we are expanding on this work with X states. Consequently, we have observed the measurement choices for a higher set with two-parameter entangled bell state measurements, as well as the behavior of the nonlocal distributions in the parameter space. Following our observations, we have confirmed the best measurement setting for different distributions of X states. We have also found the noise robustness of these nonlocal distributions considering practical scenarios. Exploring this new domain of nonlocality will give us glimpses into the defining principles of quantum nonlocality and its wide applications. 

### Masters Thesis - Quantum Network Nonlocality

Abstract

Witnessing nonlocal correlations lies at the core of the foundational aspects of quantum mechanics, and such correlations have huge applications in information processing. In the case of simple bipartite quantum systems, we can achieve this by using Bell inequalities. But as soon as the scenario grows in complexity, relying on the Bell inequalities becomes unfeasible. This is where machine learning can provide an alternative for detecting and quantifying non-locality. Since machine learning structures such as neural networks are classical, it is possible to show if a quantum distribution is nonlocal or not by letting the machine learn it and make it reproduce the distribution, i.e. we are using classical resources to reproduce an observed probability distribution that arises from measurements on a quantum state. If the distribution is local, the machine can learn it; if nonlocal the machine can't reproduce it, and we can try to use this disparity to create a measure for nonlocality. We are focusing on the triangle case of nonlocality which was proposed by Renou_2019 which shows a novel kind of nonlocality that does not require measurement inputs, unlike the standard Bell nonlocality.

### Minor Thesis - Superadditivity of Coherent Information in Noisy Quantum Channels

Abstract

 Machine learning has greatly improved the attainability of solutions when it comes to challenging problems such as those in fundamental research. Here, we use machine learning to tackle a quantum information scenario. Quantum channels exhibit a convenient property called superadditivity which can improve transmission rates in quantum information channels. In this work we found quantum states expressing Superadditivity using neural network variational ansatz and optimization algorithms; through this we explored the usefulness of using neural network as a variational state ansatz for representing Quantum qubit states in the context of quantum information-processing tasks, and also the efficiency of using different optimization algorithms to find the better case. (a) Neural network states yield quantum codes with a high Coherent-information for Qubit pauli channels, Dephrasure channel and De polarizing channel; such codes have proven to outperform all other known codes for these channels. (b) It has also been shown that the quantum codes for single channel cases were given by repetition codes. (c) Using genetic algorithm has proved to be more effective than using simple gradient-based methods for optimizing the neural network ansatz representing the states.
