Abstract
------
Nonlocal correlations lie at the core of quantum foundations, and distributions displaying them are of great importance in applications of information processing. Unlike quantum systems with a convex local boundary, the nonlocality without inputs in networks is of particular interest as it deviates from the standard bell inequality violation criteria. Nonlocality being a correlation that can't be reproduced by a classical structure, machine learning with classical sources was later introduced as a counter test for the same. These works were particular to bell states, we are expanding on this work with X states. Consequently, we have observed the measurement choices for a higher set with two-parameter entangled bell state measurements, as well as the behavior of the nonlocal distributions in the parameter space. Following our observations, we have confirmed the best measurement setting for different distributions of X states. We have also found the noise robustness of these nonlocal distributions considering practical scenarios. Exploring this new domain of nonlocality will give us glimpses into the defining principles of quantum nonlocality and its wide applications.
