### Masters Thesis - Quantum Network Nonlocality

Abstract

Witnessing nonlocal correlations lies at the core of the foundational aspects of quantum mechanics, and such correlations have huge applications in information processing. In the case of simple bipartite quantum systems, we can achieve this by using Bell inequalities. But as soon as the scenario grows in complexity, relying on the Bell inequalities becomes unfeasible. This is where machine learning can provide an alternative for detecting and quantifying non-locality. Since machine learning structures such as neural networks are classical, it is possible to show if a quantum distribution is nonlocal or not by letting the machine learn it and make it reproduce the distribution, i.e. we are using classical resources to reproduce an observed probability distribution that arises from measurements on a quantum state. If the distribution is local, the machine can learn it; if nonlocal the machine can't reproduce it, and we can try to use this disparity to create a measure for nonlocality. We are focusing on the triangle case of nonlocality which was proposed by Renou_2019 which shows a novel kind of nonlocality that does not require measurement inputs, unlike the standard Bell nonlocality.
